# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

Description:

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to build a machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. Financial institutions process millions of transactions daily, and detecting fraudulent activity in real-time is crucial for minimizing losses and maintaining customer trust.This project leverages supervised learning techniques on an imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions represent a very small fraction of the total. By applying data preprocessing, feature scaling, resampling techniques, and classification algorithms, the system can distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions.

Key Objectives

Detect and classify fraudulent transactions accurately.
Handle imbalanced datasets using methods such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or undersampling.
Optimize model performance using techniques like cross-validation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
Compare various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to find the best performer.
